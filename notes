Create our component. Add the three main files: weather.component.ts, weather.component.html, and weather.component.css.

Once we have created our files we have to setup our component.ts file.
First import component from angular core: import { Component } from '@angular/core'
Next create the component decorator:
  @Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector: 'weather-widget',
    templateUrl: 'weather.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['weather.component.css']
  })
  This will be different from Angular 5 but for this course giving the module Id will allow us to have paths from the folder we are in.
  Make sure to not forget that the stylesUrls is an array.

  Then create the class: export class WeatherComponent { }
Now go to app.module.ts to declare the new Component
Import it to app.module : import { WeatherComponent } from filepath

then add component to declaration array.

Creating a service.
Create a new folder in the weather-widget folder called service.
Next add a file called weather.service.ts in the new service folder
inside your new file we need to import Injectable from angular/core:
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

next we need to add Injectable() into our service files
then we need to export our class
export class WeatherService{ }
Now since we want to use it in our weather component we have to import it into our component file.
import { WeatherService } from '../service/weather.service';
then underneath our styles declaration add a providers key with the value being an array and containing WeatherService. now we have imported our service into our component and have listed it as a a provider.
Now we need to add a constructor to our component.
Inside our class add constructor(){} following that we need to do dependency injection with our service. so inject weather service into our constructor.
constructor(private :service WeatherService){ }
We are injecting a private service with a type of weatherservice into our constructor function.
