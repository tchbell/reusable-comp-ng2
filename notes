Create our component. Add the three main files: weather.component.ts, weather.component.html, and weather.component.css.

Once we have created our files we have to setup our component.ts file.
First import component from angular core: import { Component } from '@angular/core'
Next create the component decorator:
  @Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector: 'weather-widget',
    templateUrl: 'weather.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['weather.component.css']
  })
  This will be different from Angular 5 but for this course giving the module Id will allow us to have paths from the folder we are in.
  Make sure to not forget that the stylesUrls is an array.

  Then create the class: export class WeatherComponent { }
Now go to app.module.ts to declare the new Component
Import it to app.module : import { WeatherComponent } from filepath

then add component to declaration array.
